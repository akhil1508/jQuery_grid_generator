This application that I made will generate a grid with a number of squares that the users will input. 
It will then take an input of the length of the grid in pixels. It will then generate a square grid whose squares upon hovering will randomly change color. 
Made entirely using jQuery and CSS. Purpose was to practice jQuery.
